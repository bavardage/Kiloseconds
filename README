The kiloseconds project is a very sophisticated and exquisite, ego-boosting and mind-blowing (albeit perhaps a bit over-engineered) project which aims to provide its audience with the time in kiloseconds, since we cannot live without it.

Commiting Rules:

Every new programming language added needs to be put in a seperate folder like for example  haskell/kilseconds.hs

Every kiloseconds implementation must be named ks[-foobar].* (use a -foobar to distinguish several implimentations
example: perl-gtk2.pl)
If the implimentation has more than 1 file, create a subdirectory for it.

Also every commit must be signed off  -s
